I’m still converting some of my old flash games and experiments into JavaScript. This time I redid an old memory game (concentration) I had called “Remember Me”, but decided to use icons and renamed it “Iconcentration”.

This project was done with Next.js. It was a good practice of useEffect. Once a card was flipped, useEffect was used to update different state variables, and once those variables were updated, useEffect was used again to calculate whether there was a match and if the game was completed.

The icons used came from [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).
